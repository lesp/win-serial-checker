From your *nix box, get your Windows serial!

All this is, is a simple bash script, that can be made executable

```
chmod +x win-serial
```

And then you can copy it to your ```/usr/bin``` directory for easy access and use.

```
sudo cp win-serial /usr/bin/
```

Nothing fancy, just something quick and easy to call on!
